## Objective
  
  As someone who is fascinated by the progression of space exploration, I love watching rocket launches. But often times staying up to date with rocket launches can be a handful. To alleviate this problem I created Launch Master. Easily keep track of and learn about upcoming and past launches from agencies around the globe. Never miss the countdown again with Launch Master!
